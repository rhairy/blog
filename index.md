# Welcome to my blog!

I'm super stoked to document my trials, tribulations, and discoveries on my career journey!

## Who am I?

I usually tell people I am one of the following: I'm an "IT Guy!" A computer janitor. An "ops" guy. Even for people in the industry, it can be hard to articulate exactly what someone like me does.

What do I do now? I patch and backup EC2 instances on AWS.  I generate platform health KPIs! I jump on critical calls and ponder why that message queue is not getting smaller.  I help developers troubleshoot their dotnet code!

In short I am a jack of all trades and I love dropping into high pressure situations and unblocking teams.
